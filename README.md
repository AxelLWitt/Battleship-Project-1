## Bugs
* To the best of my knowledge, I am unaware of any remaining bugs outside of manipulating the game through console commands. If you happen to find some in a live and un-manipulated state, please let me know.

## Ice box
* Implementing random ship placements.
* Implementing an single player mode with AI integration.
* Showing the ship imaged within the tiles hit.
